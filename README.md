This repository contains test cases for the Meta Wallet App, a decentralized digital wallet for managing cryptocurrencies and NFTs. 
The test cases are designed to ensure the functionality, usability, security, and performance of the application meet the required standards.

What Are Test Cases?
A test case is a specific scenario or set of conditions under which a system, software, or application is tested to verify that it functions as expected. It is a detailed set of steps, inputs, and expected results that help ensure the software works properly and meets its requirements.

Test cases are designed to:

1. Validate that the system performs the functions it was designed to perform.
2. Identify any bugs or defects in the software.
3. Verify the usability, performance, and security of the system.

A typical test case includes:

1.Test Case ID:  A unique identifier for the test case.
2.Description:  A brief explanation of what the test case is validating.
3.Preconditions:  Any requirements or setup needed before executing the test (e.g., user must be logged in).
4.Test Steps:  A step-by-step guide on how to execute the test.
5.Test Data:  Input values or data to be used during the test.
6.Expected Result:  The outcome that is expected if the system works correctly.
7.Actual Result:  The outcome after running the test.
8.Status:  Pass or fail, depending on whether the actual result matches the expected result.

Why Is a Test Case Template Made?
A test case template is used to standardize the format and structure of test cases.
It ensures consistency and clarity when documenting tests, which is important for teams working on large or complex software projects.
